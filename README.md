# k-clustering
## Purpose of this project?
This project is my practise with k-means clustering. This technique uses euclidean distance to find which object are most closely related. The number of eventual object groups depends on how many times clustering is completed. This particular project uses values from countries.csv to cluster most closely-related countries.
